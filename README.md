We don't just use debt to pay for needs as people. To control its economy, a nation may also borrow money. One expensive component needed for a nation's population to enjoy pleasant lifestyles, for instance, is infrastructure spending. The body responsible for lending money to nations is the World Bank.

Data on global debt gathered by The World Bank will be examined in this notebook. The dataset includes data on the total amount of debt (in USD) that developing nations are responsible for across various categories. We'll learn the answers to inquiries like:

What is the total debt owed by the nations included in the dataset?
Which nation has the highest debt, and how much debt does it have?
